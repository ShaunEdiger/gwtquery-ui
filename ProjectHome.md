# About Gwt Query UI #
Gwt Query UI is a plugin for the great [Gwt Query](http://code.google.com/p/gwtquery/) project that enables the use of the fabulous [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) project.

This project is **not** a rewrite of jQuery UI in GWT (sorry), it is an integration of the JavaScript library as a Gwt Query plugin.

I started this project because I wanted to use jQuery UI with GWT. I wanted a Java binding to facilitate development but I did not want to rewrite the jQuery UI library.

By integrating the JavaScript library as a Gwt Query Plugin we  get a nice jQuery-like API without having to re-write jQuery UI in GWT.

## See it ##
jQuery UI's site has a rich set of demos and samples. These have been re-written using this plugin. Both the HTML and the Java source are shown for each sample.

Although not complete, the latest demos are available [here](http://gwtquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/demos/GwtQueryUi.html).

## Use it ##
Please refer to the GettingStarted page instructions on how to use this plugin.
